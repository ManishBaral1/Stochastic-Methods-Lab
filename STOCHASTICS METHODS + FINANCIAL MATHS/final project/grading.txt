# ----------------Point distribution----------------
#
# General:
# - single runnable file + input data files: 2 out of 2 points
#
# Choice of a good stock:
# - found a suitable stock: 0.5 out of 2 points
# (Microsoft is a dividend paying stock; this would change the option pricing.)
# (The source of stock and option data is not given.)
# - enough data: 1 out of 2 points
# (You only have data for one maturity.)
# - handling csv files: 2 out of 2 points
#
# (a) Time Series:
# - normally distributed? (QQ plot): 1.5 out of 2 points
# (Discussion of plot missing.)
# - independently distributed? (autocorrelation plot): 1.5 out of 2 points
# (Discussion of plot missing.)
# - volatility estimate: 2 out of 2 points
#
# (b) Risk-free interest rate:
# - right rate from ECB or US treasury (or other suitable source): 1 out of 4 points
# (No source given, only one rate looked up.)
# - interpolation: 0 out of 2 points
# (No interpolation or different appropriate rates.)
#
# (c) Option pricing:
# - working pricing algorithm: 4 out of 4 points
# - evaluated different maturities and strike prices: 1 out of 2 points
# (No different maturities.)
# - good comparison to data (e.g., plots): 1 out of 4 points
# (Insufficient comparison to data: Just one plot (without good labeling) without explanation or discussion.)
# 
# (d) Option Pricing Methods:
# - list of methods: 1.5 out of 2 points
# (Finite difference method for Black-Scholes equation missing.)
# - list of advantages/disadvantages: 1 out of 2 points
# (Many inaccuracies.)
# Note: At least the following methods and advantages/disadvantages were discussed in class:
# -- Binomial tree (very versatile)
# -- Black-Scholes formula (very efficient, but must be modified for options other than European calls)
# -- Monte-Carlo method (usually very efficient)
# -- Black-Scholes equation (works for different payoffs)

# Total points: 20 out of 34 points
