We discussed mainly 3 methods for Option pricing in the lectures:
1. Black Scholes Method
2. Binomial Model
3. Monte Carlo Method


1.Monte Carlo Method
- best for pricing options where the payoff is path dependent
- can be used with any probability distribution i.e. not limited to normal or lognormal returns
-sometimes, varying statistical parameters allowed 


2. Black Scholes
advantages:
- Speed: calculate option price in very short time.
- high accuracy not cricical for american option, so prefered
-
disadvantages:
-not as accurate as Binomaial Model	
	

3.Binomial Model
advantages:
-Acuracy

disadvantages:
-slow
